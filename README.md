# Rain-prediction-using-MLP-classifier

The data for this weather prediction project was sourced from Kaggle, originally provided by the Australian weather agency. The goal is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on present conditions. While data for various locations was available, 'Perth' was chosen for the current analysis. The data underwent cleaning, processing, and transformation to fit into a neural network structure. A Grid Search was conducted, varying the number of hidden layers and the nodes in each hidden layer to optimize the network. The model achieved a 90% accuracy rate.
